# RMDS_Stock_Sentiment_Challenge
Team Mahoodworth's submission for RMDS Labs 2021 challenge

#Project Overview:
In this project, we attempted to predict the stock price of oil companies utilizing linear regressions. Our independent variables included: competitor's stock prices, oil market conditions, and sentiment scores for relevant news sources.

#Config Instructions:
This program was written in Google Colab and should run there easily. We recommend uploading the .ipynb file into google Colab and then uploading our provided datasets into your Colab session in order to run the file. It was written on a Windows operating system.

#Installation Instructions:
The first block of code includes the packages necessary. Running the first cell will fulfill any requirements needed for our script. 

#A list of files included:
I have included a python notebook compete with the code and analysis written by our team. Additionally, I have added the data file.
